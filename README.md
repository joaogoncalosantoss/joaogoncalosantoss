<h1 align="center">👋🏻 Hi, I'm João Gonçalo Santos</h1>

<strong><p align="center">
  a Computer Science Engineer currently pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity and Software Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST). I'm naturally curious and deeply motivated to understand how things work — continuous learning drives my growth.

  Supported by a research scholarship, I am currently working on my thesis project in collaboration with the <strong>Portuguese National Security Office (GNS)</strong>, where I am developing a <strong>Key Management System (KMS)</strong> to secure military communications by managing the full lifecycle and hierarchical distribution of cryptographic material across a network of operational stations.

  Outside of tech, I remain curious about topics such as personal finance and investments. I enjoy understanding what exists, studying different perspectives, listening to those with more experience, and applying the knowledge through my own reasoning.
